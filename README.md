The problem this project seeks to address is the efficient management and processing of employee payroll data, including employee hours worked, overtime, bonuses, and deductions. The objective of the project is to design a relational database system that handles payroll records, while ensuring data integrity, minimizing redundancy, and improving query efficiency. The methodology will involve creating a normalized relational database structure, implementing SQL views for simplified user queries, and ensuring transaction management to maintain consistency. This will be achieved by building a two-table structure (Employee and Payroll), defining relevant views for HR and managers, and incorporating advanced SQL queries for payroll processing.
